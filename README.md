# Getting Started with Trivia

Dependencies needed: node, yarn

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies by running "yarn".

In the project directory, you can run "yarn start" to run the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

With additional time, I would have added:
  - a backend with score persistence & user info
  - a player leaderboard
  - a form for question submission
  - an option to "challenge your friend" to the same round with an "email challenge" option at the end
